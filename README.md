# Lifebuoy Carrying Quadcopter Drone

## About
The following is one of our undergraduate project where we made a drone out of store-bought part. This drone was designed to carry and drop a lifebuoy near an active drowning victim where he/she can reach easily and where she can stay afloat while waiting for the rescuer to arrive. 

## Concept Design
The drone's structural components are made out of PVC pipes and other materials that can easily be found in a random hardware store. The rest of the electronics other than the <b>Audrino Microcontroller</b> and the 4 brushless motors are just basic electronic parts that can be bought easily also. Even the drone controller is from an old toy of mine.
