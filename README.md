# Libuoy carrying quadcopter drone
To rescue the drowning victim without endangering the life of the rescuer, this study will be aimed to design and fabricate a drone that can carry lifebuoy or floatation device. 
This drone can carry and drop a lifebuoy near an active drowning victim where he/she can reach easily and where she can stay afloat while waiting for the rescuer to arrive. 
This device can reach and save the victim faster, which can lessen the health risk or complication of the victim compared to lifeguards swimming to the accident site. 
Thus, both can be a complement with each other, one of the rescuers controls the drone and drop a floatation device near the drowning victim while another rescuer swims toward the site to rescue the victim and bring him/her back the shore then gives an appropriate medical attention and care.
